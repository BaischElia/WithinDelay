# Delay Awareness in Aim Training – Prototype Extension

This project extends an existing aim-training prototype used to study delay perception in human computer interaction. The original setup presents targets without delay on the left side of the screen and with delay on the right. In this version, delayed targets are additionally color coded so users can visually distinguish them.

## Goal
Analyse how visual cues influence user performance, perceived difficulty and awareness of delay. The experiment uses mixed sequences of delayed and non delayed targets within a single run to enable direct comparison under identical task conditions.

## Features
- Existing aim trainer prototype extended with visual cues  
- Color coded delayed targets  
- Mixed target presentation for controlled testing  
- Data collection for performance and perception analysis  

## Repository Content
- Prototype source code  
- Experiment logic  
- Config files and assets  
- Documentation materials  

## Status
Work in progress – functionality and experiment structure will be refined.
